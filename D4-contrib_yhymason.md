For this deliverable my main role is to develope all the graphical interface and handle input fields
as well as the output displays. By correctly collecting clean inputs the scheduler made by my teammate
can thus run correctly and by collecting the return values from scheduler, I also made sure they display
correctly on the interface. Also I designed and implemented the report utility of our UI.
