For D2, my main focus is on making upgrades to addDataset and ensuring that all data are added as clean and well-formatted JSON objects.
Also, in order to fit all the new keys that were added from rooms' htmls, I also made improvements to validation functions for performQuery
interface. This time we started earlier and we were well coordinated, thus we were able to hit 100% for both D1 and D2.
Next time we want to keep up the good trend and good work.
My main commits are for examples:

Which gave us almost perfect addDataset
https://github.com/CS310-2017Jan/cpsc310project_team185/commit/6436f6a735b07c8e23d0ed2a7af05ed3d13c737a
Which gave us so far correct validations.
