Web Course Scheduler   UBC                                          Jan-April 2017      
In a team of 2, we built a web course scheduler to import, read, and analysis the UBC courses and rooms information dataset, and schedule specific courses into specific rooms in a timetable.

My role in the team:

• Built a query engine by Typescript to enable flexible querying over a diverse dataset and a fast result computation within 0.7s.

• Adapted the query engine to robust REST endpoints so that remote clients can use the project.

• Designed an intuitive UI by HTML for invoking the REST backend and displaying data from it.
